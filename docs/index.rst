**SQLconnect** is a Python package designed to simplify the process of connecting to SQL databases. 
It uses a ``connections.yaml`` file to securely store database connection details and allows users to execute SQL queries stored in ``.sql`` files. 
This package is particularly useful for data analysts and developers who need a straightforward way to interact with SQL databases.
